W-AlignACE is not available, 404.

The 2 algorithms I could run produced different motifs.

At the same time there are some important similarities if you shift the second one a couple of positions to the right. In that case, most of the low entropy positions match! ???GGG?C????G?CCC???

20.

Very similar, most important difference is just an offset of one element.

It depends, small motifs will run faster, so you can run end up finding your result fast by favoring smaller lengths.

On the other side too small motif lengths can be statistically irrelevant.

---

In order to generate typical DNA strings of the same length that are typical to a collection of DNA strings I would generate a weighted dice  following the probabilities of the 4 bases within those DNA strings.

The logo from upstream25 is not similar with the one from upstream250.

The logo from upstream100 is similar to the one from upstream250, but apparently not as similar as the ones from bigger upstream regions.

The logos for upstream500 upstream1000 are very similar between themselves but also to upstream250.
